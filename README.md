# JobSearch

Having recently graduated with my Masters in Data Science I have begun a job search looking for a Data Engineer style role. After applying to a couple dozen roles, I realized that keeping track of the job hunting details was beginning to become a monumental task. 

Sure, it was easy enough to keep track of the company and role I had applied for, but what if I wanted more information about the company? 

Several applications ask similar additional questions about data projects you have previously worked on, or broader questions like what makes you the right fit? I found some days I would produce really good answers to these questions, and I would want to refer back to my previous answers but once the job application had been submitted those responses had been lost to the workday either.

Finally, the data scientist in me wanted to keep track of the numbers. Several questions have pinged into my head about this job search:
- How many jobs have I applied for
- How many applications were still open
- At what stage was I failing the most on applications? (This one's not too hard, I'm not making it past the application submitted on most)

Some tougher questions to answer kept popping up too:
- Am I hearing back from jobs where the skills posted more closely align to the skills listed in my resume?
- How confident was I that I could *actually* get this job I'm applying for?

It also became apparent to me that my dream of being a data engineer was being slowed down by the fact that I have little experience when it comes to Data Engineering.

All of this has culminated into me trying to create this app called **Job Search** (or a cooler name to come)

This app will be built using Streamlit as a front end (becacuse I don't have a desire to build out a front end), and will allow me to gain some much needed experience in working with Postgresql, AWS Services, object-oriented programming, data engineering (hopefully), and much more.

Currently the app is in a development stage, but here is what I have done, and what I am planning to complete:
